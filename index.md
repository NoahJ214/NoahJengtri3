Create Task

I was thinking of doing something like a quiz or survey that the user can interact with. It will be similar to the pair/group create task that we did last tri.

## 5.1 and 5.2 Notes
-Microtransactions: purchases made in free games/apps
They are little payments for you to get cosmetics, paywall functionality, and are pay-to-win

-Digital Divide: Growing gap between the underprivileged and poor in our society. They do not have access to technology

-Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.

-The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
Demographics
Age
Religion

-The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals

-The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.

-The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

-Explain how bias exists in computing innovations
* Reflect human biases b/c bias written into algorithms and data
* Programmers should try to actively reduce bias
* Bias is embedded at all levels of software

-Examples
-Netflix
-Explicit Data
1. Thumbs up/down
2. Name address etc
-Implicit
1. When you watch
2. What you binge
3. Style of shows watched

-Biases
* Exclusives featured first
* Subscriptions
* Can be intentional

# Github Pages Actions
1.) Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial:
-Devices can perform more advanced functions to help people in everyday life
-People can communicate with each other across the world through devices
-Provides instant access to information, for example the internet

Harmful:
-People can become addicted to technology, such as social media and video games
-People communicate in person less, since they can just message each other with devices
-Social media changes the way people view the world, since one can easily be manipulated by false info that spreads on the internet

2.) Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
-Dopamine issues are real, and technology can create a very negative impact on people's lives. Many technological activities, such as playing video games, can cause kids to become addicted and spend less time on their homework or studies. Another aspect of technology that has a big impact on many teens' lives is social media. People can become addicted to social media, which can change their opinions on topics as well as distract them from their education.




1.) How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

People can empower themselves in a digital world by educating themselves with the help of technology. With technology and the internet, you have instant access to any information you want, therefore when people are trying to learn a new skill, new topic, or subject, they can use the internet as an aid in their education process. 

2.) How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

You can help someone that is not empowered by lending them a digital device that they can use for school work, if they can't afford one. You could also teach people who aren't tech savvy how to use technology to help them in their studies. 

3.) Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Many rules are in place at Del Norte that prevent digital empowerment. For example, not all teachers allow phones or computers in class. Computers are a great aid even during lectures since you can quickly look up stuff or terms that you don't understand.
